# node.js-learning-journey

Welcome to my Node.js learning documentation!

This repository is my personal learning log as I explore Node.js, Express, and related backend technologies. I’m keeping weekly notes and small code demos to track my progress and help others who might be learning as well.


## Structure

- `week-1.md`, `week-2.md`, etc — My notes for each week’s learning and practice.
- `code-examples/` — Mini projects or code snippets to apply what I learn.
- `ROADMAP.md` — My high-level plan of topics to cover.
- `resources.md` — Useful links, tutorials, articles I’ve found helpful.

## Why this repo?

✅ To document what I learn daily/weekly
